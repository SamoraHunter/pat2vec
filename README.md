**View the Live Documentation**

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Patient-Level Aggregation
Compute summary statistics (e.g., the mean of *n* variables) for each unique patient, resulting in one row per patient. This is ideal for models requiring a single representation per individual.

### 2. Longitudinal Time Series Construction
Generate a monthly time series for each patient that includes:

- Biochemistry results
- Demographic attributes
- MedCat-derived clinical text annotations

The time series spans up to 25 years retrospectively, aligned to each patient's diagnosis date, enabling a consistent retrospective view across varying start times.

## Requirements

**Core Services:**
- **CogStack**: An operational instance for data retrieval. The required client libraries are now bundled with this project.
- **Elasticsearch**: The backend for CogStack.
- **MedCAT**: For medical concept annotation.

**Local Setup:**
- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher.
- **Virtual Environment**: Requires the `python3-venv` package (or equivalent for your OS).
- For all other Python packages, see `requirements.txt`.

## Features

`pat2vec` offers a flexible suite of tools for processing and analyzing patient data.

**Patient Processing**
- **Single & Batch Processing**: Process individual patients for detailed analysis or run large batches for cohort-level studies.

**Cohort Management**
- **Cohort Search & Creation**: Define and build patient cohorts using flexible search criteria.
- **Automated Control Matching**: Automatically generate random control groups for case-control studies.

**Flexible Feature Engineering**
- **Modular Feature Selection**: Choose from a wide range of feature extractors to build a custom feature space tailored to your research question.
- **Temporal Windowing**: Define precise time windows for data extraction relative to a key event (e.g., diagnosis date), including look-back and look-forward periods.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended for Users)

Once `pat2vec` is installed, you can use it as a library in your Python projects.

1.  **Install the package:**
    ```shell
    pip install pat2vec
    ```

2.  **Install all optional dependencies (for full functionality):**
    ```shell
    pip install pat2vec[all]
    ```

### From Source (For Developers/Contributors)
The following instructions are for setting up a development environment from the source code.

#### Windows

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Navigate to the directory where you want to store your projects. It's recommended to have a parent directory to hold `pat2vec` and its related assets.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/SamoraHunter/pat2vec.git
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script:**
    Navigate into the cloned repository and run the batch script. This will create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and set up a Jupyter kernel.

    ```shell
    cd pat2vec
    install.bat
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment:**
    To use the installed packages, activate the virtual environment:
    ```shell
    pat2vec_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Set up for your IDE/Notebook:**
    If you are using an IDE like VS Code or a Jupyter Notebook, make sure to select the `pat2vec_env` kernel to run your code.

5.  **Post-Installation Setup:**
    The script sets up the Python environment, but you must manually arrange other project assets. In the parent directory of your `pat2vec` clone, you will need to:
    -   **Clone the helper repository**:
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/SamoraHunter/snomed_methods.git
        ```
    -   **Add MedCAT model**: Create a `medcat_models` directory and copy your MedCAT model pack (`.zip`) into it.
    -   **Add credentials**: Create a `credentials.py` file. You can use `pat2vec/pat2vec/config/credentials_template.py` as a starting point.

    Your final directory structure should look like the one described in the Usage section.

#### Unix/Linux

The `install_pat2vec.sh` script is the recommended way to set up a development environment on Unix-like systems. It automates the full setup, including:
- Creating a Python virtual environment (`pat2vec_env`).
- Installing Python dependencies (including development and testing tools).
- Cloning the `snomed_methods` helper repository.
- Creating required directories and template files (e.g., for MedCAT models and credentials).

To install, clone the repository, navigate into it, and run the script:
    Grant execution permissions and run the script. It must be run from within the `pat2vec` directory.

    ```shell
    chmod +x install_pat2vec.sh
    ./install_pat2vec.sh
    ```

    The script supports several options:
    -   `--proxy`: Use if you are behind a corporate proxy that mirrors Python packages.
    -   `--dev`: Installs development dependencies (e.g., `pytest`, `nbmake`) for running tests.
    -   `--all`: Installs all optional feature dependencies.
    -   `--force`: Removes any existing virtual environment and performs a clean installation.
    -   `--no-clone`: Skips cloning the `snomed_methods` repository if you already have it.

    For example, to install for development behind a proxy:
    ```shell
    ./install_pat2vec.sh --proxy --dev
    ```

After running the script, you must perform two manual steps:
    The script creates a directory structure in the parent folder of `pat2vec`.
    -   **Place MedCAT model:** Copy your model pack into the `medcat_models` directory created by the script.
    -   **Populate credentials:** Edit the `credentials.py` file created by the script and fill in your details.

Finally, activate the environment to begin working:
    ```shell
    source pat2vec_env/bin/activate
    ```

## Usage

This guide outlines the steps to run a `pat2vec` analysis after completing the installation.

### 1. Finalize Project Setup

Before running an analysis, ensure your project directory is set up correctly. If you used the `install_pat2vec.sh` script, much of this is done for you.

1.  **Populate `credentials.py`**: In the parent directory of your `pat2vec` clone, edit `credentials.py` with your Elasticsearch credentials.
2.  **Add MedCAT Model**: Copy your MedCAT model pack (`.zip`) into the `medcat_models` directory.

Your final directory structure should look like this:

```
your_project_folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.py              # <-- Populated with your credentials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ medcat_models/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_model.zip          # <-- Your MedCAT model pack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snomed_methods/             # <-- Cloned helper repository
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pat2vec/                    # <-- This repository
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebooks/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example_usage.ipynb
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### 2. Prepare Input Data

Create a CSV file containing your patient cohort. This file must include:
- A column named `client_idcode` with unique patient identifiers.
- Any other relevant columns, such as a diagnosis date for aligning time series data.

Place this file in an accessible location, such as a new `data` folder inside `pat2vec/notebooks/`.

### 3. Configure and Run

The `example_usage.ipynb` notebook provides a template for running the pipeline.

1.  **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to `pat2vec/notebooks/` and open `example_usage.ipynb`.
2.  **Select the Kernel**: Ensure the `pat2vec_env` Jupyter kernel is active.
3.  **Configure the Analysis**: In the notebook, locate the `config_class`. This object controls all parameters for your run. You will need to set:
    - Paths to your input cohort CSV and output directories.
    - The list of features to extract.
    - Time windows for data extraction (look-back/look-forward periods).
4.  **Run the Pipeline**: Execute the cells in the notebook to process your data.

> **Note:** When working with real patient data, ensure the `testing` flag in the `config_class` is set to `False`.


## Building the Documentation

This project uses Sphinx to generate documentation from the source code's docstrings.

1.  **Install development dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, run the installation script with the `--dev` flag to install Sphinx and its extensions.
    ```shell
    ./install_pat2vec.sh --dev
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```shell
    source pat2vec_env/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Build the HTML documentation:**
    Navigate to the `docs/` directory and use the provided `Makefile`.
    ```shell
    cd docs
    make html
    ```

4.  **View the documentation:**
    The generated files will be in `docs/build/html/`. You can open the main page in your browser:
    ```
    open docs/build/html/index.html
